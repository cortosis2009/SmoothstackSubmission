## Notes

I'd ordinarily not use the useState hook as the primary state management for an application, but it is what was presented in the provided code. I would much prefer to use a tool such as Zustand or Redux to manage state so that code is cleaner and easy to modify for future use. This also helps with the testability of the application. I would also recommend Typescript for an additional layer of reliability. I also like to keep functionality out of App.jsx as much as possible to keep it cleaner, but I left it as provided aside from moving the filters to a component.

I provided a couple of unit tests to demonstrate my ability to write them.
